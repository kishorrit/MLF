# Readme
Hi, you have found the GitHub repository for Machine Learning for Finance.
The book was developed here, but as we are approaching publication, we have taken the markdown files offline.

You can find the book here: https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/machine-learning-finance

If you have been asked to review the book, shoot us an email and we will send over the chapters.
